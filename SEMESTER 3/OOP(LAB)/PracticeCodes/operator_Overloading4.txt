Perfect question — and this is one of the **most important** things to understand about operator overloading in C++ 👏

Let’s look at this line closely:

```cpp
Thing three = one + two;
```

---

### 🧠 Step-by-step breakdown:

#### 1️⃣ Who calls the `operator+`?

In **binary operator overloading** (like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.),
the **left-hand operand** is the one that **calls the operator function**.

So this:

```cpp
one + two
```

is equivalent to:

```cpp
one.operator+(two);
```

✅ That means:

* `one` is the **caller (the left operand / `this` object)**
* `two` is passed as the **argument (`obj`)**

---

### 🧩 Inside your class:

```cpp
Thing operator+(const Thing& obj) {
    Thing temp(*this);     // copies the caller (left side)
    temp.x += obj.x;       // adds the right side's value
    return temp;
}
```

Here:

* `this` → points to `one`
* `obj` → is `two`

---

### 🧮 Execution flow:

Let’s walk through it:

```cpp
Thing one = 1;
Thing two = 2;
Thing three = one + two;
```

1. `one` calls `operator+`, so → `this = &one`
2. `two` is passed as `obj`
3. Inside operator+:

   * It copies `one` into `temp`
   * Then adds `two.x` into `temp.x`
   * Returns `temp` (which becomes `three`)

So effectively:

```
three.x = one.x + two.x
```

---

### 🧾 Output visualization (with prints):

Try this small edit:

```cpp
Thing operator+(const Thing& obj) {
    cout << "this->x = " << this->x << ", obj.x = " << obj.x << endl;
    Thing temp(*this);
    temp.x += obj.x;
    return temp;
}
```

**Output:**

```
this->x = 1, obj.x = 2
```

→ Confirms that `one` is the caller and `two` is the argument.

---

### 💡 Quick summary:

| Expression  | Caller (`this`)                                                      | Argument (`obj`) |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `one + two` | `one`                                                                | `two`            |
| `A + B + C` | `(A + B)` (temp)                                                     | `C`              |
| `10 + one`  | ❌ Error (unless you make a **non-member** operator+ for int + Thing) |                  |
