## 🧩 1️⃣ SHL — Shift Logical Left

### 📘 Syntax:

```
SHL destination, count
```

### ✅ Purpose:

Shifts all bits of the **destination** to the **left** by the number of positions in `count`.

### ⚙ Rules:

* **Leftmost bit(s)** are discarded.
* **Zero(s)** are filled into the **rightmost bit(s)**.
* `count` can be:

  * 1 (immediate)
  * or value in **CL** register (for variable shifts).

---

### 🔍 Example 1:

```asm
MOV AL, 00000101B   ; AL = 5
SHL AL, 1           ; Shift left by 1 bit
```

🧠 Working:

```
Before: 00000101B (5)
After:  00001010B (10)
```

So effectively:
👉 `SHL AL,1` = multiply by 2

✅ CF (Carry Flag) = last bit shifted out (leftmost bit before shifting).
Other flags affected: **OF, SF, ZF, PF**

---

### 🔍 Example 2:

```asm
MOV AL, 00001111B   ; AL = 0Fh (15)
SHL AL, 2
```

🧠 Working:

```
00001111B → 00111100B
= 3Ch = 60 decimal
```

💡 Each shift left = multiply by 2
So `SHL AL, 2` = multiply by 2² = 4
15 × 4 = 60 ✅

### ⚙ Flags Affected:

| Flag | Meaning                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CF   | Last bit shifted out (leftmost bit before shift)                |
| OF   | Defined only for 1-bit shifts: it becomes XOR of new MSB and CF |
| SF   | Sign flag (depends on new MSB)                                  |
| ZF   | Set if result = 0                                               |
| PF   | Parity flag updated                                             |

## 🧩 2️⃣ SHR — Shift Logical Right

### 📘 Syntax:

```
SHR destination, count
```

### ✅ Purpose:

Shifts all bits of **destination** to the **right** by the number of positions in `count`.

### ⚙ Rules:

* **Rightmost bit(s)** are discarded.
* **Zeros** are filled into the **leftmost bit(s)**.
* Used for **unsigned division by 2ⁿ**.

---

### 🔍 Example 1:

```asm
MOV AL, 00001010B   ; AL = 10
SHR AL, 1
```

🧠 Working:

```
Before: 00001010B (10)
After:  00000101B (5)
```

👉 `SHR AL,1` = divide by 2

✅ CF = last bit shifted out (rightmost bit before shift)

---

### 🔍 Example 2:

```asm
MOV AL, 00110000B   ; AL = 48
SHR AL, 2
```

🧠 Working:

```
00110000B → 00001100B
= 0Ch = 12 decimal
```

48 ÷ 2² = 12 ✅

### ⚙ Flags Affected:

| Flag | Meaning                                                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CF   | Last bit shifted out (rightmost bit before shift)                    |
| OF   | Defined only for 1-bit shifts: becomes the original MSB before shift |
| SF   | Sign flag updated                                                    |
| ZF   | Set if result = 0                                                    |
| PF   | Parity updated                                                       |

| SAR         | Right       | Sign-bit fill | Arithmetic | Divide **signed** number by 2ⁿ | signed ÷ 2ⁿ           |

## 💡 Example: Both Together

```asm
MOV AL, 5     ; 00000101B
SHL AL, 1     ; 10  (×2)
SHR AL, 1     ; 5   (÷2)
```
