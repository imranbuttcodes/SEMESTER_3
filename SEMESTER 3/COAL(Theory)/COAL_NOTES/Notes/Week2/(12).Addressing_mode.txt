Now that you understand **registers, segments, and memory models**,
learning **addressing modes** will *finally connect* how the CPU **accesses data from memory** using those registers.

### ⚙️ What are Addressing Modes?

👉 **Addressing mode** means **the way an instruction finds (addresses) its operands (data)**.
In other words — *how the CPU knows where the data is coming from or going to*.

Example:

```asm
MOV AX, BX
MOV AX, [2000h]
MOV AX, [BX]
```

All 3 have **different addressing modes** — same operation, different ways of locating data.

---

### 🧩 Why We Need Addressing Modes

Because in assembly, **data can come from many places**:

* inside a register
* in memory at a fixed address
* in memory at an address stored in a register
* at an address formed by combining registers + offsets
* or even directly as an immediate constant

---

Let’s go one by one deeply 🔍

### 1. **Immediate Addressing Mode**

📦 The data (operand) is given **directly** in the instruction.

Example:

```asm
MOV AX, 1234h
```

💡 Meaning:

* AX ← 1234h
* No memory or register lookup.
* Fastest and simplest — data is *immediate*.

---

### 2. **Register Addressing Mode**

🧠 The data is inside a **register**.

Example:

```asm
MOV AX, BX
```

💡 Meaning:

* AX ← contents of BX
* Both operands are in registers
* No memory access, super fast.

---

### 3. **Direct Addressing Mode**

🏠 The instruction gives the **exact memory address**.

Example:

```asm
MOV AX, [1234h]
```

💡 Meaning:

* AX ← contents at memory address 1234h
* Data segment (DS) register gives the segment base
* So the actual physical address = DS × 10h + 1234h

---

### 4. **Register Indirect Addressing Mode**

📍 The memory address is **stored inside a register**.

Example:

```asm
MOV AX, [BX]
```

💡 Meaning:

* AX ← contents of memory at address (DS × 10h + BX)
* BX contains the *offset* inside the data segment

Registers that can hold indirect addresses:

> BX, BP, SI, DI

🧠 BP is special — it uses **SS** (Stack Segment) by default, not DS.

---

### 5. **Indexed Addressing Mode**

📏 Address is formed by **adding a base offset + index register**.

Example:

```asm
MOV AX, [BX + SI]
MOV AX, [BP + DI]
```

💡 Meaning:

* Useful for arrays or structures
* Both registers together form the effective address

Default segments:

| Base             | Segment Used |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| BX, SI, DI       | DS           |
| BP, (BP + SI/DI) | SS           |

---

### 6. **Based + Indexed + Displacement (Complex Addressing)**

🏗️ Combines base + index + a constant offset.

Example:

```asm
MOV AX, [BX + SI + 05h]
```

💡 Meaning:

* AX ← contents of DS:[BX + SI + 05h]
* Used for accessing array elements, records, etc.

---

### 7. **Relative Addressing Mode (for jumps)**

🏃 Used in control instructions like `JMP`, `CALL`, etc.

Example:

```asm
JMP LABEL
```

💡 Meaning:

* Jump to a location **relative** to current instruction pointer (IP).

So in summary 🧭

| Mode                           | Example             | Source of Data               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Immediate                      | MOV AX, 10          | Inside the instruction       |
| Register                       | MOV AX, BX          | Another register             |
| Direct                         | MOV AX, [2000h]     | Exact memory address         |
| Register Indirect              | MOV AX, [BX]        | Memory address from register |
| Indexed                        | MOV AX, [BX+SI]     | Base + index register        |
| Based + Indexed + Displacement | MOV AX, [BX+SI+05h] | Base + index + offset        |
| Relative                       | JMP LABEL           | IP-relative jump             |
