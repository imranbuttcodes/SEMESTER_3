Perfect bro 🔥 — that’s exactly the kind of deep curiosity you need!
Let’s take this line apart piece by piece — and I’ll show you how **`msg`**, **`db`**, and **`dw`** actually work **inside memory** (no skipping details 👇).

---

## 🧠 The Line:

```asm
msg db "Hello", "$"
num dw 1234h
```

---

## 💡 1️⃣ What is `msg`?

➡️ `msg` is **not** a built-in keyword.
It’s **a variable name (label)** — a name that **you define**.

In Assembly, you can name memory locations yourself.
For example:

```asm
msg db "Hello"
name db "Imran"
num dw 1234h
```

Here:

* `msg` is a **label (variable name)** for a memory location that stores `"Hello"`
* `num` is a **label (variable name)** for a memory location that stores the value `1234h`

So `msg` is basically saying:

> “Assembler, please reserve memory somewhere in the data segment, and mark its address with the name `msg`.”

Later, when you write:

```asm
lea dx, msg
```

It means:

> “Load the **address of msg** into DX register.”

💬 `msg` = memory address (label)
🧠 You can think of it as similar to:

```cpp
char msg[] = "Hello";
```

in C++.

## 💡 2️⃣ What is `db`?

`db` means **Define Byte**
It tells the assembler how much space to reserve and what to store there.

| Directive | Meaning           | Size    | Example                     |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| `db`      | Define Byte       | 1 byte  | `db 5` → stores 05h         |
| `dw`      | Define Word       | 2 bytes | `dw 1234h` → stores 34h 12h |
| `dd`      | Define Doubleword | 4 bytes | `dd 12345678h`              |
| `dq`      | Define Quadword   | 8 bytes | `dq 1234567890ABCDEFh`      |

So,

```asm
msg db "Hello", "$"
```

→ means:

> Store each character of "Hello" followed by "$" as bytes in consecutive memory locations.

🧠 `"Hello", "$"` is **6 bytes total:**

| Character | ASCII (Hex) |
| --------- | ----------- |
| H         | 48h         |
| e         | 65h         |
| l         | 6Ch         |
| l         | 6Ch         |
| o         | 6Fh         |
| $         | 24h         |

---

So in memory (inside Data Segment):

| Address   | Value     | Label |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| 2000:0000 | 48h ('H') | msg   |
| 2000:0001 | 65h ('e') |       |
| 2000:0002 | 6Ch ('l') |       |
| 2000:0003 | 6Ch ('l') |       |
| 2000:0004 | 6Fh ('o') |       |
| 2000:0005 | 24h ('$') |       |

So, `msg` points to the address **2000:0000** (first byte).

---

## 💡 3️⃣ What is `dw`?

`dw` = **Define Word** = 2 bytes
(“word” = 16 bits in x8086)

So:

```asm
num dw 1234h
```

means → reserve **2 bytes** in memory, and store the hexadecimal value **1234h**.

⚠️ Remember that the 8086 is **little-endian**, meaning:

> The lower byte is stored first.

So in memory:

| Address   | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| 2000:0006 | 34h   |
| 2000:0007 | 12h   |

---

## 🧩 Summary:

| Element   | Meaning                                       | Example                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `msg`     | Variable label (address)                      | Name of memory location |
| `db`      | Define Byte (1 byte per value)                | `db "A", 10, 20`        |
| `dw`      | Define Word (2 bytes per value)               | `dw 1234h`              |
| `$`       | End marker for DOS interrupt 21h function 09h | `"Hello", "$"`          |
| `"Hello"` | String stored as ASCII bytes                  | 6 bytes including `$`   |

---

✅ So your two lines:

```asm
msg db "Hello", "$"
num dw 1234h
```

mean in plain English:

> Create a variable called `msg` to hold the bytes for the string “Hello$”
> and another variable `num` to hold the 16-bit hexadecimal value `1234`.
