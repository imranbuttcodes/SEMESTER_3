**Summary: How a 16-bit Register Addresses 64KB Memory**

**The Core Concept:**
A 16-bit register holds a memory address (not the data itself) that can point to any location in a 64KB memory space.

**The Math:**
- 16 bits = 2^16 = 65,536 possible unique values
- Each unique value represents ONE address
- Each address points to 1 byte in memory
- 65,536 bytes = 64 KB

**Key Points:**

1. **The register holds an address:** It stores a 2-byte number (16 bits) that acts as a pointer to a memory location

2. **Address vs. Data:** The 2 bytes in the register contain the address itself, not the data stored at that address

3. **One address, not two:** Even though the address takes 2 bytes to store, it represents ONE single memory location

4. **Byte-addressable memory:** Each address points to 1 byte of storage in memory, giving you 64KB total addressable space

**Bottom Line:**
A 16-bit register is like holding a house number (2 bytes long) that can uniquely identify any one of 65,536 houses on a street - the number is small, but it's enough to reference a much larger space.
