The Intel 8086 is a 16-bit microprocessor whose architecture is organized into two separate units: the Bus Interface Unit (BIU) and the Execution Unit (EU). This design allows the microprocessor to use a pipelining technique, where the BIU fetches the next instructions while the EU is executing the current one, significantly increasing performance. 

Bus Interface Unit (BIU)
The BIU handles all communications between the 8086 and external components, such as memory and I/O devices. 
Instruction Queue: A 6-byte, First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue that stores prefetched instruction bytes from memory. The BIU automatically fills this queue during periods when the EU is busy executing instructions.
Segment Registers: The 8086 uses a segmented memory architecture to access up to 1 MB of memory using its 20-bit address bus. The BIU contains four 16-bit segment registers that store the starting addresses of these memory segments:
Code Segment (CS): Contains the base address for the memory segment holding the program's instructions.
Data Segment (DS): Contains the base address for the memory segment where program data is stored.
Stack Segment (SS): Contains the base address for the memory segment used for the stack, which stores return addresses and local data.
Extra Segment (ES): An additional segment register, primarily used for string manipulation and extra data storage.
Instruction Pointer (IP): A 16-bit register that stores the offset of the next instruction to be executed within the current code segment. The physical address of the next instruction is calculated by combining the CS and IP registers.
Address Generation Circuitry: A dedicated adder that shifts the 16-bit segment register address left by four bits (multiplying it by 16) and adds the 16-bit offset address from a pointer or index register to produce a 20-bit physical address. 
Execution Unit (EU)
The EU is responsible for decoding and executing the instructions passed to it by the BIU. 
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): A 16-bit ALU that performs all arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, AND, and OR.
General Purpose Registers: Eight general-purpose registers are available for data manipulation:
Data Registers (AX, BX, CX, DX): Can be used as a full 16-bit register or as two independent 8-bit registers (e.g., AX is composed of AH and AL).
AX (Accumulator): Used for most arithmetic, logic, and data transfer operations.
BX (Base): Can hold a memory address (offset) for indirect addressing.
CX (Count): Used as a counter in loops and string instructions.
DX (Data): Used for I/O port addressing and certain multiply/divide operations.
Pointer and Index Registers (SP, BP, SI, DI):
Stack Pointer (SP): Stores the offset address of the top of the stack.
Base Pointer (BP): Holds an offset address within the stack segment to access data.
Source Index (SI): Holds an offset address for source data in string operations.
Destination Index (DI): Holds an offset address for destination data in string operations.
Instruction Decoder: This unit takes instructions from the instruction queue and translates them into the microcode that the ALU can execute.
Flag Register: A 16-bit register that contains nine status and control flags that provide information about the result of a computation or control the EU's operation. For example, the Carry Flag (CF) is set if an arithmetic operation results in a carry, while the Zero Flag (ZF) is set if the result is zero. 
Memory organization
The 8086 organizes its 1MB addressable memory into segments, which offers several advantages. 
Segmentation: Memory is logically divided into 64KB segments, which can overlap.
Physical Address Generation: A physical address is generated by combining a 16-bit segment register value with a 16-bit offset. The segment register is shifted left by 4 bits and then added to the offset. 
Modes of operation
The 8086 can operate in two modes, determined by the state of its MN/MX pin. 
Minimum Mode: For a single-processor system, where the 8086 generates all bus control signals itself.
Maximum Mode: For a multiprocessor system, where the 8086 works with a dedicated bus controller (8288) to generate control signals.
