Perfect 👌 let’s go step by step into **Sign-Magnitude Representation**, the simplest way of representing signed numbers in binary.

---

## 🔹 1. What is Sign-Magnitude?

* We use **one bit (MSB = Most Significant Bit)** to represent the **sign** of the number.
* The remaining bits represent the **magnitude (absolute value)**.

👉 Convention:

* **0 = positive**
* **1 = negative**

So in an **8-bit system**:

* `00001010` → +10
* `10001010` → -10

---

## 🔹 2. Example with +5 and -5 (8-bit)

* +5 → `00000101`
* -5 → `10000101`

Notice: Only the **first bit** (sign bit) changes, magnitude stays the same.

---

## 🔹 3. Range in Sign-Magnitude (for n bits)

* You can represent numbers from:
  (- (2^{n-1} - 1)) to (+(2^{n-1} - 1))
* There are **two zeros**: +0 and -0.

Example:
For 8 bits:

* Range = -127 to +127
* Binary for +0 = `00000000`
* Binary for -0 = `10000000` (problematic, wasteful).

---

## 🔹 4. Why Sign-Magnitude is rarely used?

* Two zeros (+0 and -0) → confusion.
* Arithmetic (like subtraction) is complicated because of the sign handling.
* Computers prefer **2’s complement** (solves these issues).

✅ Quick practice for you:
Write **+13 and -13** in **sign-magnitude form** using 8 bits.
