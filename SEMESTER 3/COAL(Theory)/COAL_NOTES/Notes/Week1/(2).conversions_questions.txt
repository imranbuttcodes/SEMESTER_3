Before moving into complements and signed numbers, you should be **very comfortable** with conversions in all directions. Once your brain can convert instantly between decimal, binary, octal, and hex, the later COAL topics will feel *easy*.

Here’s how we’ll do it:

### **Conversion Practice Roadmap**

1. **Decimal ↔ Binary** (both ways)
2. **Decimal ↔ Octal**
3. **Decimal ↔ Hexadecimal**
4. **Binary ↔ Octal** (shortcut: group 3 bits)
5. **Binary ↔ Hexadecimal** (shortcut: group 4 bits)
6. **Octal ↔ Hexadecimal** (convert via binary in between)

---

✅ Let’s practice now:
Convert the following numbers **step by step (manually)**:

1. **77 (decimal)** → binary, octal, hexadecimal
2. **101011 (binary)** → decimal, octal, hexadecimal
3. **2F (hexadecimal)** → decimal, binary, octal
4. **345 (octal)** → decimal, binary, hexadecimal
