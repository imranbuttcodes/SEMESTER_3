In assembly language, a directive is a command given to the assembler (not to the processor) that controls the assembly process and influences how the resulting machine code is organized. Directives are used for tasks such as defining symbolic constants, reserving space for variables, allocating memory, and controlling code sections, rather than being actual executable instructions. 
Key Aspects of Directives
Instructions for the Assembler: Unlike machine instructions, which are executed by the CPU, directives are instructions for the assembler itself. 
Control and Organization: They provide the assembler with information to control the structure and organization of the program. 
Bookkeeping Tasks: Directives handle tasks like:
Defining Symbols and Constants: Using directives like EQU to assign a value to a symbol. 
Reserving Memory: Using directives like DB (Define Byte) or DW (Define Word) to allocate space for variables or data. 
Controlling Program Structure: Directives can specify memory segments, the beginning address of a section (ORG), and even the end of a program (END). 
Syntax: Directives often begin with a period (.) to distinguish them from executable instructions, though the specific syntax can vary between different assemblers. 
Examples of Common Directives 
.ORG: Sets the starting address for the following code or data.
.DB / DB: Defines and initializes memory with 8-bit data.
.DW / DW: Defines and initializes memory with 16-bit (word) data.
.EQU: Defines a symbolic constant that cannot be redefined.
.SET: Defines a symbolic constant that can be redefined.
.END: Marks the termination of the assembly language program.
