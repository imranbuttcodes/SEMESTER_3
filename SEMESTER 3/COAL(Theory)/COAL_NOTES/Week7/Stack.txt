The **stack** in 8086 assembly is a special area of memory used for storing data temporarily, supporting operations like function calls, returns, parameter passing, and saving registers. The stack operates in a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** manner: the last value pushed is the first to be popped out.

***

### Stack Basics in 8086

- **Stack Segment (SS):** Points to the segment base of the stack.
- **Stack Pointer (SP):** Points to the top of the stack (offset in SS).
- **PUSH:** Saves data onto the stack, decreases SP by 2.
- **POP:** Retrieves data from the top of the stack, increases SP by 2.

#### Example: Basic Stack Operations

```asm
MOV AX, 1234h      ; Load AX with a value
PUSH AX            ; AX is now on the stack

MOV AX, 0          ; Clear AX

POP AX             ; AX restored from the stack (now 1234h)
```

- After `PUSH AX`, the value in AX is stored at **SS:SP-2**, and SP decreases by 2.
- After `POP AX`, the value at **SS:SP** is loaded into AX, and SP increases by 2.

### Using Stack for Subroutines and Saving Registers

```asm
PUSH BX        ; Save BX before modifying
CALL MyFunc    ; Call a function (return address pushed to stack)
; ... Your code
POP BX         ; Restore BX after function call

RET            ; Return from subroutine (return address popped from stack)
```

- **CALL** instruction pushes the return address onto the stack.
- **RET** pops it back, resuming execution after the call.

### Stack Example with Comments

```asm
MOV AX, 1A2Bh    ; AX = 1A2B
PUSH AX          ; Push AX (value 1A2B) onto stack

MOV BX, 3C4Dh    ; BX = 3C4D
PUSH BX          ; Push BX (value 3C4D) onto stack

POP DX           ; Pop into DX (DX = 3C4D, since BX was last pushed)
POP CX           ; Pop into CX (CX = 1A2B, next value)

; Stack is now empty (for these operations)
```

***

### Key Points

- The stack is mostly used for temporary storage, passing parameters, handling interrupts, and subroutines.
- Always match each PUSH with a corresponding POP to keep the stack consistent.
- 8086 is a 16-bit processor, so PUSH and POP always transfer 16 bits (a full word) at a time.
