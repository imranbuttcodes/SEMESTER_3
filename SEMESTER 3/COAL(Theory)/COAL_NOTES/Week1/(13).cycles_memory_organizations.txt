Perfect bro 👑 we’ll cover **both** — step by step — because they’re deeply connected.
Let’s begin with the **Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle**, and then move to **Memory Organization** (how data/instructions are arranged and accessed).

---

# ⚙️ 1. The Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle

This is the **heart of the CPU’s operation** — the repeating process through which the CPU runs every single instruction.

You can think of it as:

> 🧠 CPU = Brain
> 📖 Program = List of Instructions
> 🔁 Cycle = How CPU “reads → understands → acts” on each instruction

---

## 🧩 Step 1: **Fetch**

👉 The CPU **fetches** (reads) the next instruction from **memory**.

🔹 Involved components:

* **Program Counter (PC):** holds the address of the next instruction.
* **Memory Address Register (MAR):** temporarily holds that address.
* **Memory Data Register (MDR):** holds the fetched instruction.
* **Instruction Register (IR):** stores the instruction currently being executed.

🔹 Step-by-step:

1. **PC → MAR:** Address of next instruction is copied to MAR.
2. **Address Bus:** carries that address to memory.
3. **Control Bus:** sends a `READ` signal.
4. **Memory → Data Bus:** sends the instruction to MDR.
5. **MDR → IR:** instruction is stored for decoding.
6. **PC++:** incremented to point to the next instruction.

🧠 Example:

```
PC = 2004
Fetch instruction at address 2004 → MOV A, B
```

## 🧮 Step 2: **Decode**

👉 The **Control Unit (CU)** interprets what the instruction means.

* The **Opcode** part (e.g., MOV, ADD, SUB) tells the CPU *what operation* to do.
* The **Operand** part (e.g., A, B, address) tells the CPU *where* to find data.

💡 Example:

```
Instruction: ADD A, B
Opcode → ADD
Operands → A, B
Meaning → Add contents of register B to register A
```

Control Unit then prepares the **ALU**, **registers**, and **buses** for execution.

---

## ⚡ Step 3: **Execute**

👉 The CPU performs the operation.

Depending on the instruction, this may involve:

* Performing arithmetic or logic in the **ALU**.
* Transferring data via the **Data Bus**.
* Storing results in memory or a register.

💡 Example:

```
ADD A, B
→ ALU adds contents of A + B
→ Result stored back in A
→ Status flags updated (e.g., Zero, Carry)
```

---

### 🔁 The Cycle Repeats

Once execution is done:

```
PC → next instruction → Fetch → Decode → Execute → Repeat
```

This happens **millions or billions of times per second** (depending on CPU clock speed).

---

# 🧠 2. Memory Organization

Now that you know *how* CPU reads instructions, let’s see *how* data and instructions are **stored**.

---

## 🔹 1. Memory = Array of Storage Locations

Memory is like a **huge array**:

```
Address | Data
0000    | 10101010
0001    | 11110000
0002    | 01010101
```

Each **address** points to **1 byte (8 bits)** of storage.

So:

* 1 KB memory → 1024 addresses
* 1 GB memory → 1,073,741,824 addresses

---

## 🔹 2. Instruction vs Data

Both **instructions and data** are stored in the same memory — this is called the **Von Neumann Architecture**.

💡 Example memory layout:

```
Address | Content
0000    | MOV A, B   (instruction)
0001    | ADD A, C   (instruction)
0002    | 00000010   (data value)
0003    | 00000101   (data value)
```

CPU doesn’t care if it’s instruction or data — the **Control Unit** interprets it correctly during decoding.

---

## 🔹 3. Memory Hierarchy (Speed vs Capacity)

| Level             | Type        | Example       | Speed      | Capacity    |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| L1 Cache          | Inside CPU  | 32 KB         | 🔥 Fastest | ⚙️ Smallest |
| L2/L3 Cache       | On CPU chip | 256 KB – 8 MB | Very fast  | Small       |
| Main Memory (RAM) | External    | 8–32 GB       | Moderate   | Medium      |
| Secondary         | HDD / SSD   | 1–2 TB        | Slow       | Huge        |

📈 The closer to CPU → faster but smaller.

---

## 🔹 4. Memory Addressing

Each instruction or variable has an **address**:

* **Direct Addressing:** specifies actual address.

  ```
  LOAD 2004
  ```
* **Indirect Addressing:** address stored in another register.

  ```
  LOAD (R1) → fetch from address in R1
  ```

## 💡 In Short:

| Concept                  | Description                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Fetch–Decode–Execute** | CPU’s instruction cycle                    |
| **Memory Organization**  | How instructions/data are stored           |
| **System Bus**           | Communication between CPU, memory, and I/O |
| **Registers**            | Temporary high-speed storage inside CPU    |
