Yes, static and global variables in your C++ code are stored in the data segment, but the specific subdivision depends on whether or not they are initialized. 
The data segment is further divided into two sections:
Initialized data segment (.data): This block of RAM holds global and static variables that you explicitly initialize with a non-zero value in your source code. The initial values are read from the executable file on the disk when the program is loaded.
Uninitialized data segment (.bss): The BSS section, short for "Block Started by Symbol," stores global and static variables that are not explicitly initialized, or are initialized to zero. Unlike the initialized data, the BSS section does not consume space in the executable file. Instead, the operating system allocates and fills this block with zeros when the program is loaded into memory, making the executable file smaller and more efficient. 
Example
Consider the following C++ code:
cpp
// This is a global variable initialized with a non-zero value
int global_var = 10; 

// This is a global variable that is not initialized
int uninitialized_global_var; 

void someFunction() {
    // This is a static variable initialized with a non-zero value
    static int static_var = 20;

    // This is a static variable that is not initialized
    static int uninitialized_static_var;
}
Use code with caution.

Here is how these variables would be stored when the program runs:
global_var and static_var will be placed in the initialized data segment (.data).
uninitialized_global_var and uninitialized_static_var will be placed in the uninitialized data segment (.bss) and set to zero at runtime.
