🔥 Perfect bro! That’s exactly right.

Let’s quickly check:

* Decimal **13** = binary **1101** (4 bits).
* In **8-bit sign-magnitude** → add leading 0’s for padding → `00001101`. ✅
* For **-13** → just flip the **sign bit (MSB)** → `10001101`. ✅

---

⚠️ Notice the **issue** here:

* `00000000` = **+0**
* `10000000` = **-0**

This duplication is one of the main reasons computers **don’t use sign-magnitude** in practice.
