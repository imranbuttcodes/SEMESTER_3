Got it bro 👍
Now that you’re comfortable with **number systems** and **signed numbers (1’s & 2’s complement)**, we can step into the **structure of a computer** — the actual “CO” part of **COAL (Computer Organization & Assembly Language)**.

# 🔹 Basic Structure of a Computer (von Neumann Architecture)

Every modern computer follows the **von Neumann architecture** model, which has these main components:

1. **Input Unit**

   * Devices: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Mic, etc.
   * Function: Takes input from the outside world and converts it into a form the computer can understand (binary signals).

2. **Output Unit**

   * Devices: Monitor, Printer, Speakers, etc.
   * Function: Converts processed binary results back into human-readable form.

3. **Memory (Storage)**

   * **Primary Memory (RAM, Cache, Registers)** → fast, temporary storage.
   * **Secondary Memory (Hard disk, SSD)** → long-term storage.
   * Memory is divided into **addressable locations**, each storing **binary data**.

4. **Control Unit (CU)**

   * “Brain” of the CPU that **fetches, decodes, and controls execution** of instructions.
   * Controls the flow of data between memory, ALU, and I/O devices.

5. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**

   * Performs **arithmetic operations** (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
   * Performs **logical operations** (AND, OR, NOT, comparisons).

6. **Registers (inside CPU)**

   * Very small, very fast memory locations.
   * Hold instructions, operands, or results temporarily.

7. **System Bus**

   * Communication pathway between CPU, memory, and I/O.
   * Has 3 types:

     * **Data Bus** → carries actual data.
     * **Address Bus** → specifies memory location.
     * **Control Bus** → carries control signals (read/write, clock, etc.).

## 🔹 The Instruction Cycle (how CPU executes code)

The CPU executes instructions in a repeated cycle called **Fetch-Decode-Execute**:

1. **Fetch** → CU takes the instruction from memory (using Program Counter).
2. **Decode** → CU interprets the instruction (what operation to do).
3. **Execute** → ALU performs the operation, result stored in registers/memory.

This cycle repeats billions of times per second (GHz = billion cycles/second).

📌 This structure is what you’ll study in COAL before you even write a single line of Assembly code.
Once you get it, you’ll see how **Assembly instructions directly control this process**.
