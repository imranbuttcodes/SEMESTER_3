You are correct. The stack segment is primarily used for storing information related to active function calls during a program's execution. This includes: 
Local variables (automatic variables)
When you declare a variable inside a function, it is allocated on the stack. This memory is temporary and is automatically reclaimed when the function finishes its execution and returns. 
Function parameters
The arguments that are passed to a function are also pushed onto the stack to be accessed by the called function. 
Return addresses
When one function calls another, the program needs to know where to resume execution after the called function is finished. The address of the instruction to return to is saved on the stack. 
The stack frame
All of this information for a single function call—local variables, parameters, and the return address—is stored together in a block of memory called a stack frame. Each time a new function is called, a new stack frame is created and pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its stack frame is popped off, and control returns to the previous function. 
This Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) behavior of the stack is what makes it so efficient for managing function calls, especially in cases of nested or recursive function calls.
