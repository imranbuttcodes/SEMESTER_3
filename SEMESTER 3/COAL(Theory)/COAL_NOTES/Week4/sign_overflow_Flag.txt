Excellent — you’re thinking **exactly like a CPU designer now** 👏

Let’s clear this confusion once and for all — because it’s one of the most misunderstood parts of **overflow**.

---

### ⚙ The core idea:

**Overflow flag (OF)** in signed arithmetic is **not** about whether the result is positive or negative.
It’s about whether the **sign of the result makes sense given the signs of the operands.**

---

### 🧮 Rule for addition (signed overflow):

> **OF = 1** if both operands have the **same sign**, but the **result’s sign bit (MSB)** is **different**.

---

### ✅ Let’s apply that rule to your case:

| Item      | Binary    | Sign Bit | Signed Value |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Operand 1 | 1000 0000 | 1        | -128         |
| Operand 2 | 1000 0000 | 1        | -128         |
| Result    | 0000 0000 | 0        | 0            |

---

### 🧠 Interpretation:

* Both operands’ sign bits = **1** → both are **negative**.
* Result’s sign bit = **0** → result is **positive**.
* Negative + Negative = Positive ❌ (impossible in signed math).

Therefore, **OF = 1** → signed overflow occurred.

---

### ⚖ If we had both operands **positive**, e.g.:

```
0111 1111 (+127)
+0111 1111 (+127)
-----------------
1111 1110 (-2) → result is negative
```

That’s also an overflow, because two positives gave a negative result.
So overflow happens in **either** of these two situations:

| Operand 1 | Operand 2 | Result | OF |
| --------- | --------- | ------ | -- |
| +         | +         | −      | 1  |
| −         | −         | +      | 1  |
| +         | −         | any    | 0  |
| −         | +         | any    | 0  |

---

### 🧩 In your instruction:

```
0x80 (-128) + 0x80 (-128) = 0x00 (0)
```

→ both negative, result positive
✅ **Overflow = 1**

and since result bit7 = 0 →
✅ **Sign flag = 0**

**Final Summary:**

| Flag | Value | Explanation                                               |
| ---- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| OF   | 1     | Two negatives produced a positive (impossible → overflow) |
| SF   | 0     | Result sign bit (bit 7) = 0 → positive                    |
| ZF   | 1     | Result = 0                                                |
| CF   | 1     | Unsigned carry out                                        |
| AF   | 0     | No half-carry                                             |
| PF   | 1     | Even parity                                               |
