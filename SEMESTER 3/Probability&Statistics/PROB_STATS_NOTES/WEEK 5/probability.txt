## 🎲 What Is Probability?

**Probability** measures how *likely* an event is to happen.
It is always a number between **0 and 1**.

| Probability | Meaning                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0           | Impossible (will never happen)   |
| 1           | Certain (will definitely happen) |
| 0.5         | Equally likely / 50–50 chance    |

Example:
If you toss a coin, the probability of getting **Heads** is
[
P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
]

## 🎯 Basic Terms You Must Know

Let’s go one by one:

---

### 1️⃣ **Experiment**

An **experiment** is any **process** that leads to a result or an outcome that cannot be predicted with certainty.

> You perform it → it gives one of many possible outcomes.

**Examples:**

* Tossing a coin
* Rolling a die
* Picking a card from a deck
* Measuring the temperature tomorrow

---

### 2️⃣ **Outcome**

An **outcome** is a **single possible result** of an experiment.

**Examples:**

* Coin toss → “Head” is an outcome.
* Rolling a die → “4” is an outcome.
* Picking a card → “Ace of Spades” is an outcome.

---

### 3️⃣ **Sample Space (S)**

The **sample space** is the **set of all possible outcomes** of an experiment.

**Examples:**

| Experiment      | Sample Space (S)   |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Coin toss       | {Head, Tail}       |
| Rolling a die   | {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} |
| Tossing 2 coins | {HH, HT, TH, TT}   |
| Drawing a card  | {all 52 cards}     |

---

### 4️⃣ **Event (E)**

An **event** is **a set of outcomes** that you are interested in.

It can include **one** or **more** outcomes.

**Examples:**

* Event A: Getting a Head → {H}
* Event B: Getting an even number when rolling a die → {2, 4, 6}
* Event C: Getting a number less than 3 → {1, 2}

So,
[
\text{Event} \subseteq \text{Sample Space}
]

---

### 5️⃣ **Probability of an Event**

If all outcomes in the sample space are **equally likely**, then:

[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes in E}}{\text{Total number of outcomes in S}}
]

**Example:**
Rolling a die, find probability of getting an even number:

[
E = {2, 4, 6}, \quad S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
]

[
P(E) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
]

### 🔹 Summary Table

| Term             | Meaning                     | Example (rolling a die) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Experiment       | Process that gives outcomes | Roll the die            |
| Outcome          | A single result             | “4”                     |
| Sample Space (S) | All possible outcomes       | {1,2,3,4,5,6}           |
| Event (E)        | Desired outcomes            | Even numbers = {2,4,6}  |
| Probability      | Likelihood of event         | 3/6 = 0.5               |
