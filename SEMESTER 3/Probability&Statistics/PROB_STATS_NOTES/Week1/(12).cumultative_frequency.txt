 et’s break down **cumulative frequency** in a simple, clear way.

### 🔢 What is Cumulative Frequency?

**Cumulative frequency** = **"Running total" of frequencies** as you go down (or up) a data list.

In other words:  
> It tells you **how many data values are less than or equal to** a particular value.

### 📊 Example to Understand It

Suppose you surveyed **20 students** about how many books they read last month:

| Books Read (x) | Frequency (f) | **Cumulative Frequency (cf)** |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| 0              | 2             | 2                             |
| 1              | 5             | 2 + 5 = **7**                 |
| 2              | 6             | 7 + 6 = **13**                |
| 3              | 4             | 13 + 4 = **17**               |
| 4              | 3             | 17 + 3 = **20**               |

✅ **How we got cumulative frequency**:
- For **0 books**: 2 students → cf = 2
- For **1 book**: 5 more students → total so far = 2 + 5 = **7**
- For **2 books**: 6 more → total = 7 + 6 = **13**
- ...and so on.

So, the **cumulative frequency for "2 books" is 13**, which means:  
> **13 students read 2 books or fewer**.

### 📈 Why Is It Useful?

Cumulative frequency helps you answer questions like:
- How many students scored **less than or equal to 75** on a test?
- How many people are **younger than 30**?
- What’s the **median** or **percentile** of a dataset?

It’s also used to draw **ogives** (cumulative frequency graphs)—super helpful in descriptive stats!

### 🧠 Quick Tips:
- Cumulative frequency **always increases** (or stays the same) as you go down the table.
- The **last cumulative frequency** = **total number of observations** (e.g., 20 students).
- There are two types:
  - **Less than cumulative frequency** (most common — shown above)
  - **More than cumulative frequency** (starts from the bottom and adds upward)

---

### ✅ Summary (Bro-to-Bro 😎):
> **Cumulative frequency = Keep adding frequencies as you go.  
> It shows the total count UP TO that point.**

So if someone asks, “How many people got 3 or fewer mistakes?” — just look at the **cumulative frequency for 3**. Done! 💯
