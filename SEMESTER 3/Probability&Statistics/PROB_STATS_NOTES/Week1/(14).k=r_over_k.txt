Great catch bro 👍 this is **super important** in making a frequency distribution table. Let’s break it down slowly, “university style.”

# 📏 Formula for Class Width

When we construct **grouped frequency distributions**, we need to decide:

* How many **classes (k)**
* How wide each class should be (**h = class width**)

The general formula is:

[
h = \frac{R}{k}
]

### 🔹 Where do these come from?

1. **Range (R):**
   [
   R = \text{Maximum value} - \text{Minimum value}
   ]
   It tells us the **spread** of data.

2. **Number of classes (k):**

* This is chosen to make the table readable.
* A “rule of thumb” is **Sturges’ Rule**:
  [
  k = 1 + 3.322 \log_{10}(n)
  ]
  where ( n = \text{sample size} ).

3. **Class width (h):**
   We divide the total spread of data (range) evenly across the number of classes.
   That’s why:
   [
   h = \frac{R}{k}
   ]

### 🔹 Example

Dataset: ( 7, 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 40, 42, 45, 48 )

* Max = 48, Min = 7
* Range ( R = 48 - 7 = 41 )
* Using Sturges’ Rule for ( n = 16 ):
  [
  k = 1 + 3.322 \log_{10}(16) \approx 5
  ]
* Class width:
  [
  h = \frac{41}{5} \approx 8.2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{round to 9}
  ]

So, each class interval should cover about **9 marks**.

---

✅ Intuition:

* ( R ) = total “length” of data.
* ( k ) = how many “boxes” you want to divide it into.
* ( h ) = how “wide” each box should be so all the data fits neatly.
