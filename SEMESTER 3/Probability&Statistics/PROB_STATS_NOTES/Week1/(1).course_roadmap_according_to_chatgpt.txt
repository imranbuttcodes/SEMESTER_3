Perfect bro 🔥 That’s a very strong move! Probability and Statistics is one of the most important subjects for CS, AI, and Data Science. Let’s treat this *university-style* 📚 — meaning:

1. **We’ll go chapter by chapter (like a syllabus).**
2. **We’ll mix theory + solved examples + practice problems.**
3. **We’ll use intuition first, formulas later.**
4. **We’ll connect it to coding / real-world applications when needed.**

## 📖 Course Roadmap (University Style)

### **Part 1: Probability Theory (Foundation)**

1. **Introduction**

   * Why study probability & statistics?
   * Randomness in real life (coin flips, data errors, AI models).
   * Terminology: experiment, sample space, event, outcome.

2. **Probability Basics**

   * Classical definition (equally likely outcomes).
   * Axiomatic definition (Kolmogorov’s rules).
   * Conditional probability, independence.
   * Bayes’ Theorem.

3. **Random Variables**

   * Discrete vs. Continuous random variables.
   * Probability mass function (PMF), probability density function (PDF).
   * Cumulative distribution function (CDF).

4. **Important Distributions**

   * Discrete: Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Poisson.
   * Continuous: Uniform, Normal, Exponential.

5. **Expectation & Variance**

   * Mean, variance, standard deviation.
   * Properties (linearity, scaling).
   * Law of large numbers.

### **Part 2: Statistics (Applications)**

6. **Descriptive Statistics**

   * Data collection & summarization.
   * Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).
   * Measures of spread (variance, std deviation, range, IQR).

7. **Sampling & Estimation**

   * Sampling methods.
   * Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
   * Point estimation, confidence intervals.

8. **Hypothesis Testing**

   * Null vs alternative hypothesis.
   * p-value & significance.
   * Common tests (z-test, t-test, chi-square).

9. **Correlation & Regression**

   * Correlation (Pearson, Spearman).
   * Simple linear regression.
   * Intro to multiple regression.

---

### **Part 3: Applications**

10. **Practical Applications**

    * Machine learning basics (why stats is backbone).
    * Probability in computer science (hashing, randomized algorithms).
    * Data analysis with Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib).

⚡ Now, like in uni, we start with **Lecture 1: Introduction to Probability & Statistics.**

* What is randomness?
* What do we mean by *sample space* and *event*?
