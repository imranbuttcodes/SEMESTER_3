Perfect timing bro 🔥 because after **Population & Sample**, the next foundation in statistics is **Variables & Types of Data**. Let’s go step by step, like in a uni lecture.

# 🎓 Lecture 4: Variables and Types of Data

---

## 📌 What is a Variable?

> A **variable** is any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be **measured or categorized** and can take different values.

* Variables can be **measured** (height, weight, marks) or **classified** (gender, blood type).
* They vary from person to person, object to object, or time to time.

💡 Example:

* Student height, GPA, age, major, city.

## 📌 Two Main Classifications of Variables

### 1️⃣ **Qualitative (Categorical) Variables**

* Describe **qualities / categories**.
* They are **non-numeric** (usually labels).
* Examples: Gender (Male/Female), Blood Group (A, B, AB, O), City name.

🔹 Subtypes:

* **Nominal** → Categories without order.

  * Example: Blood group, religion, city names.
* **Ordinal** → Categories with order/ranking, but no fixed difference.

  * Example: Education level (High School < Bachelor < Master < PhD), T-shirt size (S < M < L < XL).

---

### 2️⃣ **Quantitative (Numerical) Variables**

* Represent **numbers** that show quantity/measurement.
* Arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷) make sense here.
* Examples: Height, weight, GPA, income.

🔹 Subtypes:

* **Discrete** → Takes **countable values**, usually integers.

  * Example: Number of students in a class (20, 21, not 20.5).
  * Number of cars in a parking lot.
* **Continuous** → Takes **any value in a range**, including decimals.

  * Example: Height = 172.5 cm, Weight = 65.8 kg, Time = 4.73 seconds.

## ⚖️ **Summary Table**

| Variable Type    | Subtype    | Examples                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Qualitative**  | Nominal    | Gender, Blood Group, City                 |
|                  | Ordinal    | Education level, T-shirt size, Rankings   |
| **Quantitative** | Discrete   | No. of siblings, No. of students in class |
|                  | Continuous | Height, Weight, Time, GPA                 |

## 🎯 Real-Life Example: Student Survey

Suppose we survey UCP students:

* Name → **Qualitative, Nominal**
* Major (CS, BBA, EE) → **Qualitative, Nominal**
* Year (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior) → **Qualitative, Ordinal**
* GPA (3.2, 3.7, …) → **Quantitative, Continuous**
* Number of courses taken this semester → **Quantitative, Discrete**

---

✅ So, in Statistics:

* We first **identify variables** in data.
* Then decide **what type of variable** they are.
* That determines which **statistical methods** to apply later.
