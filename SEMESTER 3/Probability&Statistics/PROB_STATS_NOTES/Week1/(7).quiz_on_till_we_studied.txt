Nice idea bro 🔥 like a proper **university quiz** to check understanding before moving further.
We’ve covered so far:

* Motivation of Probability & Stats
* Formal Definitions (Probability, Statistics)
* Types of Statistics (Descriptive vs Inferential)
* Population, Sample, Parameter, Statistic
* Variables & Types of Data (Qualitative, Quantitative)

### **Section B – True/False**

**Q6.** Statistics can only describe data but not make predictions. (T/F)
**Q7.** Ordinal variables have order but no fixed difference between values. (T/F)
**Q8.** Every statistic is also a parameter. (T/F)
**Q9.** Probability starts with data and infers the model. (T/F)
**Q10.** Blood group is an example of a qualitative nominal variable. (T/F)

### **Section C – Short Answer**

**Q11.** Define *population* and *sample* with your own examples.
**Q12.** Differentiate between parameter and statistic with an example.
**Q13.** What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?
**Q14.** Give one real-life example of a discrete variable and one continuous variable.
**Q15.** Explain the difference between qualitative (nominal/ordinal) and quantitative (discrete/continuous) variables.

### **Section D – Applied Problem**

**Q16.** You are studying daily screen time of students:

* Collected data from 10 randomly selected students (in hours):
  4.5, 6, 5, 5.5, 7, 6.5, 5, 4, 6, 5.5

  a) What is the **sample mean** screen time?
  b) Is this value a **statistic** or **parameter**? Why?
  c) Identify the type of variable being measured.
