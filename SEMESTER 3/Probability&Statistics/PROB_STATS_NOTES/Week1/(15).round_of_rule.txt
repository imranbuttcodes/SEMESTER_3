Perfect bro ✅ let’s go deeper into **why we round class width (h)** and how it affects frequency distribution.

# 🔹 Why Round Class Width?

When we calculate
[
h = \frac{R}{k}
]
the result is often **not a whole number** (like 8.2).

But in frequency tables, **class intervals must be clean, simple, and non-overlapping**, so we **round h** to a convenient whole number.

## 🔹 Rules of Rounding Class Width

1. **Always round UP** (not down).

   * If ( h = 8.2 ), we use 9.
   * Why? Because rounding down to 8 would make the total range smaller than the data spread → last value might not fit into any class.

2. **Choose a convenient number**.

   * Example: if ( h = 4.6 ), you could pick 5.
   * If ( h = 12.3 ), pick 13 (or even 15 for neatness).

3. **Consistency is key**.

   * All intervals should have the **same width**.

## 🔹 Example: Effect of Rounding

Dataset: Marks 7–48 (R = 41), k = 5 →
[
h = \frac{41}{5} = 8.2
]

* If you round **down to 8**:

  * Intervals = 7–14, 15–22, 23–30, 31–38, 39–46.
  * Problem: value 48 doesn’t fit in any class! ❌

* If you round **up to 9**:

  * Intervals = 7–15, 16–24, 25–33, 34–42, 43–51.
  * ✔ All values (including 48) fit properly.

## 🔹 Intuition

Think of class intervals like **shelves in a cupboard**:

* If the shelf height is too small (rounding down), the tallest book (max value) won’t fit.
* If you make shelves a bit taller (rounding up), everything fits nicely.

---

✅ So the rule is:

* **Compute h = R/k**
* **Round UP** to the next whole number (or nearest convenient one)
* Build clean intervals that fully cover the dataset.
