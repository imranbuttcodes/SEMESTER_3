Perfect timing, bro 🚀. After learning about **data types and scales**, the **next natural step** is to organize data → that’s where **frequency & frequency distribution tables** come in. Let’s go “university style”:

# 📊 Frequency & Frequency Distribution

### 1. **Frequency (f)**

* **Definition:** The number of times a value (or category) occurs in a dataset.
* Example:
  Dataset of students’ favorite fruit = {Apple, Mango, Mango, Banana, Apple, Apple}

  * Apple → 3
  * Mango → 2
  * Banana → 1
    ✔ These counts are **frequencies**.

---

### 2. **Frequency Distribution**

* A way of **organizing data** into a table showing each distinct value/category and how often it appears.
* Helps to **summarize large datasets** and **visualize patterns**.

**Basic Frequency Distribution Table Example:**

| Fruit  | Frequency (f) |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Apple  | 3             |
| Mango  | 2             |
| Banana | 1             |

### 3. **Relative Frequency**

* Shows the **proportion** (or percentage) of times a value occurs relative to total data.
  [
  \text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Total Observations}}
  ]

For the fruit example (total = 6):

* Apple: 3/6 = 0.5 (50%)
* Mango: 2/6 = 0.33 (33.3%)
* Banana: 1/6 = 0.17 (16.7%)

---

### 4. **Cumulative Frequency**

* Shows the **running total** of frequencies up to a certain class/point.
* Useful in ordered data (scores, ages, income, etc.).

Example: Test scores of 10 students:
{5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10}

| Score | Frequency (f) | Cumulative Frequency (CF) |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 5     | 1             | 1                         |
| 6     | 1             | 2                         |
| 7     | 2             | 4                         |
| 8     | 3             | 7                         |
| 9     | 1             | 8                         |
| 10    | 2             | 10                        |

---

### 5. **Grouped Frequency Distribution**

* When data is **large/continuous**, we make **class intervals**.
* Example: Marks of 50 students (0–100) → group into intervals like 0–9, 10–19, 20–29 … etc.

---

✅ In short:

* **Frequency** = count
* **Relative frequency** = proportion/percentage
* **Cumulative frequency** = running total
* **Grouped frequency** = intervals for continuous/large data
