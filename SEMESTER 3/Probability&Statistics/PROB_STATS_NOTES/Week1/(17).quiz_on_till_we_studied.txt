Perfect bro ✅ Let’s make a **Comprehensive Quiz (University Style)** based on everything we’ve learned so far:

* **Probability vs Statistics (definitions & importance)**
* **Population, Sample, Parameter, Statistic**
* **Types of Statistics (Descriptive vs Inferential)**
* **Variables & Data Types (Qualitative, Quantitative, Discrete, Continuous)**
* **Scales of Measurement (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio)**
* **Frequency, Frequency Distribution, Relative Frequency, Cumulative Frequency, Class Width (h = R/k)**
