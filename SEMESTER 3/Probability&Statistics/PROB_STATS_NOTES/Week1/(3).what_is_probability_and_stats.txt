Perfect 👌 we’ll do it like a proper **Lecture 1**:

1. **Story/Intuition** (coin toss, dice, cards) → to feel randomness.
2. **Formal Definitions** → Probability & Statistics.

# 🎓 Lecture 1: Introduction

### 🎲 **Intuitive Story of Randomness**

* You flip a **coin** → outcome could be *Heads* or *Tails*.
* You roll a **die** → outcome could be any number from 1 to 6.
* You draw a **card** → outcome could be one of 52 cards.

👉 Notice something? You **don’t know** the outcome in advance, but you **know all possible outcomes**.
That’s the heart of *probability*.

### 📖 **Formal Definitions**

#### **Probability**

> Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with **measuring uncertainty**.
> Formally: If an experiment has a sample space ( S ) (all possible outcomes), and an event ( E \subseteq S ), then the probability of event ( E ) is:

[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}, \quad 0 \leq P(E) \leq 1
]

* Example:
  Coin toss → ( S = {H, T} ), event ( E = {H} ).
  [
  P(E) = \frac{1}{2}
  ]

#### **Statistics**

> Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with **collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data**.

* Two parts of Statistics:

  1. **Descriptive Statistics** → Summarizing data (mean, median, variance, charts).
  2. **Inferential Statistics** → Making predictions or decisions based on sample data (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals).

* Example:
  Suppose we ask 100 students their height.

  * Descriptive: “Average height is 170 cm.”
  * Inferential: “We are 95% confident that the average height of all university students is between 168 and 172 cm.”

### 🧠 **Big Picture Difference**

* **Probability** → starts with a model → predicts outcomes.
  (e.g., coin toss: (P(H) = 0.5)).
* **Statistics** → starts with data → infers the model.
  (e.g., after tossing 100 times, you got 48 heads → estimate (P(H) \approx 0.48)).

✅ So, Probability is *theory of randomness*.
✅ Statistics is *learning from data*.
