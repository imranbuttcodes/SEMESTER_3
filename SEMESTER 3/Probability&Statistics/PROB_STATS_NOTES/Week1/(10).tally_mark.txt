**Tally marks** are a simple, manual way to **count and record data** in statistics—especially when collecting or organizing raw data.

### ✅ What Is a Tally Mark?

- A **tally mark** is a vertical line (**|**) used to represent **one occurrence** of an item or event.
- For easier counting, every **fifth mark** is drawn as a **diagonal line** across the previous four:

```
||||  = 4  
||||̷ = 5 (the fifth mark slashes through the group)
```

So, groups are typically counted in **fives**:
- 1 → |
- 2 → ||
- 3 → |||
- 4 → ||||
- 5 → **||||̷** (or often written as ⧵ across the four)

Example of tally for 13:
```
||||̷   ||||̷   |||
(5)     (5)     (3)  → Total = 13
```

### 📊 Purpose in Statistics

Tally marks are used in the **data collection and organization phase**, especially for:

1. **Creating frequency distributions**  
   → Count how many times each value or category appears.

2. **Constructing frequency tables**  
   → Tally marks help avoid miscounting when dealing with large raw datasets.

3. **Quick manual counting**  
   → Useful in surveys, observations, or experiments done without digital tools.

| Shoe Size | Tally Marks      | Frequency |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| 6         | ||||             | 4         |
| 7         | ||||̷ ||          | 7         |
| 8         | ||||̷            | 5         |
| 9         | ||||             | 4         |

Here, tally marks make it easy to **visually group and count** responses.

### ✅ Key Points

- Tally marks are part of **descriptive statistics** (organizing raw data).
- They are **not used for analysis** but for **preliminary data summarization**.
- Mostly used with **categorical** (nominal/ordinal) or **discrete numerical** data.

### 💡 Fun Fact:
Tallying is one of the **oldest forms of counting**, dating back thousands of years—even ancient notched bones used tally-like systems!
