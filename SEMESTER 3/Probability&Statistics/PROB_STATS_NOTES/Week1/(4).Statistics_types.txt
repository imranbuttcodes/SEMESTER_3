# 🎓 Lecture 2: Types of Statistics

Statistics, as we defined earlier, is the science of **collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data**.
Broadly, it is divided into **two main types**:

---

## 1️⃣ **Descriptive Statistics**

👉 Purpose: **Summarize and describe data**.

* It does not make predictions, only **explains what the data shows**.
* Useful when you just want to get an overall picture.

### 🔹 Examples:

* **Measures of Central Tendency** → Mean, Median, Mode.
* **Measures of Dispersion** → Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Interquartile Range (IQR).
* **Data Visualization** → Bar charts, Histograms, Pie charts, Box plots.

💡 Example:
We surveyed 100 students about their daily screen time.

* Mean screen time = 5 hours.
* Standard deviation = 1.2 hours.
* Histogram shows most students spend 4–6 hours.

This is *descriptive* → it describes the data you already have.

## 2️⃣ **Inferential Statistics**

👉 Purpose: **Make predictions or decisions about a population, based on a sample**.

* Works with **probability theory**.
* Instead of just describing, it tries to **infer** conclusions about the whole population.

### 🔹 Key Concepts:

* **Population vs. Sample**

  * *Population* → the whole group (all university students).
  * *Sample* → a subset taken from the population (say, 200 students).
* **Sampling Methods** → random sampling, stratified sampling, etc.
* **Estimation** → Point estimate (mean), Confidence Intervals.
* **Hypothesis Testing** → t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA.

💡 Example:
Instead of checking screen time of *all students in Pakistan* (impossible), we sample 500 students.

* Sample mean = 5.1 hours.
* Inferential stats: “We are 95% confident that the average screen time for all students in Pakistan is between 4.9 and 5.3 hours.”

This is *inferential* → it makes predictions/generalizations.

| Feature         | Descriptive Stats 📝              | Inferential Stats 🔮                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**        | Summarize data                    | Make predictions about population                    |
| **Data needed** | Whole dataset                     | Sample from dataset                                  |
| **Techniques**  | Mean, Median, Std Dev, Graphs     | Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals, Regression |
| **Example**     | “Average student height = 170 cm” | “True average height is likely between 168–172 cm”   |

✅ **In short:**

* **Descriptive Statistics** → *What happened?*
* **Inferential Statistics** → *What will happen (generalization)?*
