Excellent question bro 🙌 this shows you’re thinking critically!

Let’s go step by step:

# 📊 What if Dataset Has Odd Number of Observations?

The **number of observations (n)** being odd or even does **not** affect how we calculate **class width (h)**.
👉 Why? Because class width depends on the **range (R)** and the **number of classes (k)**, not whether ( n ) is odd or even.

## 🔹 Process Recap

1. **Range (R):**
   [
   R = \text{Max} - \text{Min}
   ]

2. **Number of classes (k):**
   [
   k = 1 + 3.322 \log_{10}(n)
   ]

* Here ( n ) can be odd or even, doesn’t matter.
* This gives an approximate number of classes.

3. **Class width (h):**
   [
   h = \frac{R}{k}
   ]
   Then **round up** to the next whole/convenient number.

## 🔹 Example with Odd n

Dataset (n = 15 students’ marks):
`6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 29, 33, 36, 40, 43, 47`

* **Range (R):**
  [
  R = 47 - 6 = 41
  ]

* **Number of Classes (k):**
  [
  k = 1 + 3.322 \log_{10}(15) \approx 1 + 3.322(1.176) \approx 4.9 \approx 5
  ]

* **Class Width (h):**
  [
  h = \frac{41}{5} \approx 8.2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 9
  ]

So intervals would be:
6–14, 15–23, 24–32, 33–41, 42–50

✔ All 15 values fit neatly.

## 🔹 Key Point

👉 Whether ( n = 15 ) (odd) or ( n = 16 ) (even), the formula works the same.
The **oddness or evenness of n only matters** when you’re calculating things like **median** (since median depends on whether you pick the middle value or the average of two).

But for **frequency distributions**, we only care about **range and number of classes**.

---

✅ So short answer:
Odd or even number of data points does **not** affect the width of classes. You always calculate width the same way:
[
h = \frac{R}{k}, \quad \text{round up.}
]
