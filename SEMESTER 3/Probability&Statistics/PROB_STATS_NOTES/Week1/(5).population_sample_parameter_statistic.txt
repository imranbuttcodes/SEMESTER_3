Exactly bro 💯 you’re touching the **core foundation** now — let’s formalize it university style.

# 🎓 Lecture 3: Population, Sample, Parameter, Statistic

### 📌 **Population**

> A **population** is the **entire collection of individuals, objects, or events** about which we want to draw conclusions.

* It can be **finite** (number of students in your university) or **infinite** (number of coin toss outcomes in the future).
* Population = **whole group** we are interested in.

💡 Examples:

* All students in UCP.
* All voters in Pakistan.
* All possible dice rolls in probability theory.

---

### 📌 **Sample**

> A **sample** is a **subset of the population**, selected for study.

* Since studying the whole population is often **impossible or impractical**, we use samples.
* If the sample is chosen properly (random sampling), it can represent the population.

💡 Examples:

* 200 randomly selected UCP students (to study average GPA).
* 1,000 voters surveyed out of millions.

---

### 📌 **Parameter**

> A **parameter** is a **numerical value that describes the population**.

* It is usually **unknown** (because we can’t study the whole population).
* Fixed, but often not measurable directly.

💡 Examples:

* True average GPA of *all UCP students* (say, 3.1).
* True percentage of voters supporting a candidate (say, 54%).

---

### 📌 **Statistic**

> A **statistic** is a **numerical value computed from the sample data**.

* Used to estimate the parameter.
* Changes depending on which sample you take.

💡 Examples:

* Average GPA of your 200 sampled students (say, 3.05).
* 1,000 surveyed voters: 52% support candidate → estimate for true population %.

## ⚖️ **Comparison Table**

| Concept        | Based On             | Numerical Value Called | Example                                |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Population** | Entire group         | **Parameter**          | True avg GPA of all UCP students = 3.1 |
| **Sample**     | Subset of population | **Statistic**          | Avg GPA of 200 sampled students = 3.05 |

---

✅ **In short:**

* **Population** → Whole group.
* **Sample** → Small part of group.
* **Parameter** → Numerical value of whole group.
* **Statistic** → Numerical value of sample.
