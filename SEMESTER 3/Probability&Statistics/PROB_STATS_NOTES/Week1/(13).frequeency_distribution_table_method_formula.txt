Got it bro ✅ let’s go deeper into **Frequency Distribution** step by step, like how it’s taught in university.

# 📊 Frequency Distribution

### 🔹 Definition:

A **frequency distribution** is a systematic way of **organizing raw data** into **classes/intervals** along with their frequencies.
👉 Purpose: To see patterns, spread, and concentration of data at a glance.

## 1. **Types of Frequency Distribution**

1. **Univariate frequency distribution**

   * Based on **one variable**.
   * Example: Students’ marks in a test.

2. **Bivariate frequency distribution**

   * Based on **two variables** at once.
   * Example: Students’ marks vs their attendance.

3. **Multivariate frequency distribution**

   * Based on **three or more variables**.
   * Example: Marks, attendance, and study hours.

## 2. **Parts of a Frequency Distribution Table**

* **Class Interval (CI):** The range of values grouped together (e.g., 0–9, 10–19, etc.).
* **Tally Marks:** Quick way to count frequencies.
* **Frequency (f):** The number of observations in each class.
* **Relative Frequency (rf):** Frequency ÷ Total.
* **Cumulative Frequency (CF):** Running total of frequencies.

## 3. **Steps to Construct a Frequency Distribution (Grouped Data)**

Let’s say we have students’ marks (out of 50):
`7, 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 40, 42, 45, 48`

**Step 1: Find Range (R)**
[
R = \text{Max} - \text{Min} = 48 - 7 = 14
]

**Step 2: Decide Number of Classes (k)**
Use **Sturges’ Rule**:
[
k = 1 + 3.322 \log_{10}(n)//1 = 3.322*log(n)
]
Here (n = 16) students →
[
k = 1 + 3.322 \log_{10}(16) ≈ 5
]

**Step 3: Class Width (h)**
[
h = \frac{R}{k} ≈ \frac{41}{5} ≈ 8.2 \quad (\text{round to } 9)
]
h = r/k

**Step 4: Create Class Intervals**
Start at 7 (lowest score). Intervals of width 9:

* 7–15
* 16–24
* 25–33
* 34–42
* 43–51

**Step 5: Make the Table**

| Class Interval | Tally | Frequency (f) | Cumulative Frequency (CF) |   |    |   |    |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------------------- | - | -- | - | -- |
| 7–15           |       |               |                           | 3 | 3  |   |    |
| 16–24          |       |               |                           |   | 3  | 6 |    |
| 25–33          |       |               |                           |   |    | 4 | 10 |
| 34–42          |       |               |                           |   |    | 4 | 14 |
| 43–51          |       |               |                           | 2 | 16 |   |    |

✔ Total = 16 (matches dataset).

## 4. **Types of Frequency Distributions (by format)**

* **Simple Frequency Distribution:** Only class & frequency.
* **Relative Frequency Distribution:** Adds percentage/proportion.
* **Cumulative Frequency Distribution:** Adds running totals.

Q17: descriptive statistic is used to describe data,insights, like in graphs or distibution tables etc.. and summerize them while inferential statistics is used to make predictions and decisions based on sample data
Q18: Nominal data: blood groups(A,B,AB,O) 
Ordinal data: Grades(A>B>C>D>F) 
Interval data: temperature like 0-10C,10-20C
Ratio data: distance like 10-20 km,40-50 km
