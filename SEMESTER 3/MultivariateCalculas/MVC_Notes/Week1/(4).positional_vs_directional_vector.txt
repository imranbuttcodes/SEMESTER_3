Difference Recap:

If a vector is drawn from the origin to a point, it’s called a position vector.
Example: For 
𝑄
(
−
5
,
2
,
2
)
Q(−5,2,2), position vector is 
𝑂

=⟨−5,2,2⟩.

If a vector is drawn from one point to another, it’s called a direction vector (or displacement vector).
Example: From 
𝑃
P to 
𝑄
Q, direction vector is
