Perfect bro 👌 now we’ll move to **displacement vector**, which is a very natural step after position & direction vectors.

# 📘 **Displacement Vector**

---

### 1. **Definition**

A **displacement vector** represents the change in position of an object when it moves from one point to another.

* If an object moves from point (P(x_1, y_1, z_1)) to point (Q(x_2, y_2, z_2)), the displacement vector is:

[
\vec{D} = \vec{PQ} = \langle x_2 - x_1, ; y_2 - y_1, ; z_2 - z_1 \rangle
]

So mathematically, **displacement vector = direction vector from initial point to terminal point**.

### 2. **Difference from Position Vector**

* **Position vector** locates a point relative to the origin.
  Example: (Q(-5, 2, 2)) → position vector is (\vec{OQ} = \langle -5, 2, 2 \rangle).

* **Displacement vector** measures how much you moved when going from one point to another.
  Example: From (P(-3, 4, 1)) to (Q(-5, 2, 2)) → displacement is (\vec{PQ} = \langle -2, -2, 1 \rangle).

### 3. **Geometric Meaning**

Think of yourself standing at (P).

* You walk to (Q).
* The **arrow** from (P) to (Q) is the displacement vector.
* It shows both:

  * **how far** you moved (magnitude)
  * **in which direction** you moved

### 4. **Magnitude of Displacement Vector**

The length of the displacement vector gives the **distance between the two points**:

[
|\vec{PQ}| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
]

---

### 5. **Example**

Let’s use your same points:
( P(-3, 4, 1), ; Q(-5, 2, 2) ).

Displacement vector:
[
\vec{PQ} = \langle -2, -2, 1 \rangle
]

Magnitude (distance):
[
|\vec{PQ}| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (1)^2}
= \sqrt{4 + 4 + 1}
= \sqrt{9} = 3
]

✅ So the displacement is an arrow (\langle -2, -2, 1 \rangle) with length 3.
