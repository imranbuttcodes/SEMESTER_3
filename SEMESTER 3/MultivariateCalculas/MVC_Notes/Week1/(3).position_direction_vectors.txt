Got it bro 👍 this is an important foundation because **position vector** and **direction vector** are the building blocks of multivariable calculus and physics. Let’s break them down clearly, university style:

---

# 📘 **Position Vector & Direction Vector**

---

## 1. **Position Vector**

👉 A **position vector** tells us the position of a point relative to the **origin**.

* If a point in 2D is (P(x,y)), then the position vector is:
  [
  \vec{OP} = \langle x, y \rangle
  ]
* If a point in 3D is (P(x,y,z)), then the position vector is:
  [
  \vec{OP} = \langle x, y, z \rangle
  ]

⚡ Example (2D):
Point ( P(3,4) ) → Position vector is:
[
\vec{OP} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle
]
Magnitude: ( |\vec{OP}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 ).

⚡ Example (3D):
Point ( P(2, -1, 5) ) → Position vector is:
[
\vec{OP} = \langle 2, -1, 5 \rangle
]

📌 **Interpretation**:
The position vector “anchors” a point to the origin. Every point in space corresponds to a position vector.

## 2. **Direction Vector**

👉 A **direction vector** tells us the **direction** of a line, ray, or movement in space.

* It doesn’t have to start from the origin; it only shows direction.
* Usually, we get it from **two points**:

If (A(x_1, y_1, z_1)) and (B(x_2, y_2, z_2)),
the **direction vector** of line (AB) is:
[
\vec{AB} = \langle x_2 - x_1, ; y_2 - y_1, ; z_2 - z_1 \rangle
]

⚡ Example:
Point ( A(1,2,3) ), ( B(4,6,7) ) →
[
\vec{AB} = \langle 4-1, 6-2, 7-3 \rangle = \langle 3, 4, 4 \rangle
]

📌 **Interpretation**:

* The direction vector tells us the “slope” or “orientation” of the line.
* If we normalize it (make its length = 1), we get a **unit direction vector**, useful in physics and calculus.

---

## 3. **Relationship Between Them**

* A **position vector** fixes a point’s location in space relative to origin.
* A **direction vector** gives the orientation of movement or line, independent of origin.

👉 Example Combined:
Suppose a line passes through point (P(1,2,3)) and has direction vector ( \vec{d} = \langle 2, -1, 4 \rangle ).

Equation of the line:
[
\vec{r} = \vec{OP} + t\vec{d}
]
where (t \in \mathbb{R}).

This is the standard vector equation of a line.

✅ **Summary in one line:**

* **Position vector** = locates a point relative to origin.
* **Direction vector** = gives orientation of a line/movement.
