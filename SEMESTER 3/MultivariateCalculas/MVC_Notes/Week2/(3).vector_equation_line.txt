Perfect bro 🔥 — let’s smoothly jump **back into our main topic:**
👉 **Vector Equation of a Line in 3D**,
but this time we’ll re-understand everything clearly and link it with all the vector knowledge we’ve built (dot, cross, direction, position vectors, etc.).

## 🧭 1. What is a Line in 3D?

In **2D (x–y plane)**, a line is determined by:

* A **point** it passes through, and
* A **slope**.

In **3D (x–y–z space)**, we can’t use slope the same way — because now a line can tilt in any direction in space.
So instead of “slope,” we use a **direction vector**.

---

## 🧩 2. To define a line in 3D, we need:

1. **A point on the line** ( P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0) )

   * We’ll use its **position vector**:
     [
     \vec{r_0} = x_0\hat{i} + y_0\hat{j} + z_0\hat{k}
     ]

2. **A direction vector** ( \vec{d} = a\hat{i} + b\hat{j} + c\hat{k} )

   * This tells us the line’s orientation in 3D space.

## 🧠 3. Equation of the Line (Vector Form)

Now imagine **any general point (P(x, y, z))** on the same line.
Its **position vector** is:
[
\vec{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}
]

---

Since the line passes through (P_0) and has direction (\vec{d}),
the vector from (P_0) to (P) must be **parallel** to (\vec{d}).

That means:
[
\overrightarrow{P_0P} = t\vec{d}
]
for some scalar (t) (the parameter).

But,
[
\overrightarrow{P_0P} = \vec{r} - \vec{r_0}
]
So:
[
\boxed{\vec{r} = \vec{r_0} + t\vec{d}}
]

This is the **vector equation of a line in 3D** ✅

## 🔹 4. Cartesian Form of the Line

If
[
\vec{r_0} = x_0\hat{i} + y_0\hat{j} + z_0\hat{k}
\quad \text{and} \quad
\vec{d} = a\hat{i} + b\hat{j} + c\hat{k}
]

then:
[
\vec{r} = (x_0 + ta)\hat{i} + (y_0 + tb)\hat{j} + (z_0 + tc)\hat{k}
]

Comparing both sides:
[
x = x_0 + ta, \quad
y = y_0 + tb, \quad
z = z_0 + tc
]

These are called the **parametric equations** of the line.

---

### From this, we can also write the **symmetric form**:

[
\boxed{\frac{x - x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}}
]

---

## 💡 5. Meaning of Parameter (t)

* (t) is a **real number** that determines position on the line:

  * (t = 0 \Rightarrow) point (P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0))
  * (t = 1 \Rightarrow) one unit of direction vector away
  * Negative (t \Rightarrow) opposite direction

So, (t) controls *how far and in which direction* we move along the line.

---

## 🧮 6. Example

Find the **vector equation** and **parametric equations** of a line that passes through
(P_0(2, -1, 3)) and has direction vector (\vec{d} = \langle 4, 2, -5 \rangle.)

---

### Vector Form:

[
\vec{r} = (2\hat{i} - \hat{j} + 3\hat{k}) + t(4\hat{i} + 2\hat{j} - 5\hat{k})
]

---

### Parametric Form:

[
x = 2 + 4t,\quad
y = -1 + 2t,\quad
z = 3 - 5t
]
